# Prolog_Spring_Expert_System
## **üöÄ Project short description:**
The project is an expert system that uses the logical programming language Prolog to define advisory conditions in the field of Japanese animations. Integrated with Java and Spring, the project provides a user interface that allows users to ask questions about anime. Using the knowledge base in Prolog, the system provides personalized answers and recommendations. Integration with Spring allows for dependency management, handling HTTP requests, and testing, ensuring reliable and personalized advice on anime based on logical rules.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How to use**

1. **Development Environment**: This project was developed using the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, which is recommended for use. We cannot guarantee that the project will work correctly in other environments, which may lead to issues with Prolog.

2. **Java and Prolog Installation**: Before starting to work with the project, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Prolog language installed. Additionally, we recommend downloading the SWI-PROLOG tool, which provides the JPL (Java Prolog Linkage) library.

3. **Path Configuration**: Prolog is an older programming language, so it may be necessary to add the appropriate paths in the system that point to JAR files that allow you to use JPL in conjunction with Java. Make sure you have these paths configured correctly.

4. **Prolog File**: The Prolog file is included in the interface project immediately, making it easy to use the project. However, if you plan to make changes to the Prolog knowledge base, remember to maintain compatibility between the files.
